didn\u2019t secure a training contract offer, first of all, I know the feeling. And I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ve seen the application process become more competitive than ever, and I have met so many candidates in the last cycle who have really put their heart into this process, only to face rejection.</p>\n<p>Or maybe you\u2019re just starting out, and you see the people around you talking about vacation schemes and training contracts. It\u2019s stressful when you find out law firms are receiving 4,000 applications for 25 places. How are you supposed to know where to even begin?</p>\n<p>At TCLA, we&#8217;re here to help. We give you personalised coaching and training to help you get a training contract.</p>\n<p>We look forward to meeting you soon.</p>\n                <div class=\"ctas\">\n    \n        \n</div>            </div>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        <section id=\"newsletter-signup\" class=\"stripe text-image-stripe style-b text-left with-image no-flex bleed\" data-equalizer data-equalizer-on-stack=\"true\">\n                        <div class=\"row full-width collapse below\" data-equalizer-watch>\n                    <div class=\"column large-6 float-right\">\n                        \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n                    <div class=\"imgbg-inner \" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/newsletter-mockup-1-scaled-e1627635145952.jpg);\" data-equalizer-watch>\n                            </div>\n        \n            \n    </a>\n        \n    \n    \n        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"row above\">\n                        \n                        <div class=\"column large-5\">\n\n                        <div class=\"text-area\" data-equalizer-watch>\n                                <h2>7 Days to a Training Contract</h2>                            <p>In one email each day, we tell you what you need to know to get a training contract.</p>\n                            <div class=\"ctas\">\n    \n                                                <a href=\"https://thecorporatelawacademy.kit.com/3c3e0115f4\"  class=\"cta button primary button\">Get Started Now!</a>\n                                        \n</div>                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                    </section>\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        <section id=\"forum\" class=\"stripe text-image-stripe style-a text-left with-image flex\" data-equalizer>\n                                    <div class=\"row stripe-content\">\n                <div class=\"column medium-6\">\n                    <div class=\"text-area\" data-equalizer-watch>\n                            <h2>The UK\u2019s biggest community of rising corporate legal stars</h2>                        <p>Meet a community of over 20,000 aspiring lawyers, future trainee solicitors and graduate recruiters, receive advice on how to become a successful candidate, and build your confidence, skills and knowledge to excel as a commercial lawyer.</p>\n                        <div class=\"ctas\">\n    \n                                                <a href=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/forum/\"  class=\"cta button button primary\">Visit our community \ud83d\ude0a</a>\n                                        \n</div>                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"column medium-6\">\n                    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n                    <div class=\"imgfg text-center image-offset\">\n\n                <img src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tcla-mac-forum.png\" />\n                \n                \n            </div>\n        \n            \n    </a>\n        \n    \n    \n        \n                </div>\n            </div>\n                    </section>\n\n    \n\n<section id=\"\" class=\"stripe testimonial-stripe  style-a\">\n\n\n    <div class=\"testimonial full-width\">\n        \n                    <h2 class=\"title text-center\">Wall of Fame</h2>\n                            <p class=\"subtitle text-center\"><span>A snapshot from thousands of aspiring lawyers...</span></p>\n        \n                <div class=\"slick-testimonial\">\n        \n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p>Mahesh was incredible!

The interview didn\u2019t feel intimidating at all and was very well tailored towards the firm I am applying for. At the same time, the questions were challenging enough to be useful and thought provoking. Mahesh also gave insight into tailoring interview answers to different types of firms (ie. US vs UK).

It looked quite complicated and like something I wouldn&#8217;t be able to answer. Jaysen and Alice encouraged us to say what we think as &#8220;we will only get marked on what we say&#8221;. This gave me the confidence to communicate my thoughts in a safe environment. I tried my best to incorporate my feedback from my last session which I also found extremely helpful. I really enjoyed how relatable Jaysen and Alice made the case study. I know with practice and the guidance of Alice and Jaysen, I will continue to making progress and hopefully learn to articulate my ideas better/</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>AB</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have just received a training contract offer from [redacted] (my dream firm) and I just wanted to write to you to say a big THANK YOU for creating this platform and being so supportive.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before this cycle, I was very lost with my applications and did not really know what I was doing wrong.

It feels surreal to be a future trainee at one of my top choice firms and I couldn\u2019t have got to where I am without TCLA.</p>\n<p>I started this process around 18 months ago, a couple of weeks after I graduated. I remember my first open day at Latham &amp; Watkins \u2013 I did not understand a single technical term that was mentioned, whether that be loan covenants or the lifecycle of a PE investment. But the day piqued my interest and I met Alice, who later introduced me to TCLA. I was amazed \u2013 I found a community who shared my goal and a wealth of resources. TCLA accelerated my progress, helping me to secure VS at [redacted] and [redacted], something I never thought was possible. And a few months later, I finally have the TC.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>AG</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Redacted] offered me a training contract on Friday!!!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going from CCD with no mitigating circumstances to receiving 4 vacation scheme offers and now a training contract offer is a story that I definitely want heard.

The TCLA community has been THE MOST supportive thing out there for me during my time in Law School (and it should help during my job hunt after graduation).\u00a0</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>BC</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewFormContent\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemList\" role=\"list\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-item-id=\"714599031\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">One of the best interactive sessions I have attended by far. Closely simulates a real assessment environment with regards to the structure, the content and the questions asked. Even though I found it challenging, I learnt a lot and it gave me confidence to face and prepare for my real upcoming assessments. This is a perfect way to prepare for interviews and case studies going forward and the membership is worth every penny! Jaysen and Alice provide the perfect balance between them while both providing informative information and personal advice to takeaway from the session. One piece of constructive feedback is that I wish the sessions were either longer or slightly smaller groups as I didn&#8217;t want it to end.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>BG</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p>Wanted to write you this email to let you know I\u2019ve got a place on the [redacted] Summer Internship.

I mentioned that I was working at [redacted], had undertaken a few vacation schemes and was especially nervous about my upcoming vacation scheme at [redacted]. We discussed the feedback from my previous scheme with [redacted] and ways to improve, at which point you suggested practicing the case study on TCLA and scheduling a mock interview with Arun Sohan-Pall.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a few months since that conversation\u2026and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased to let you know that after completing the virtual vacation scheme at [redacted], I was offered a training contract!!! Thank you so much to you for speaking to me back then and giving me the confidence to give the scheme my best shot.</p>\n<p>I have been using TCLA since 2018 and have utilised both the application review service and the mock interview with Arun. I can attest to the quality of both, as well as the TCLA platform more generally. It was so useful when it came to preparing for upcoming assessment centres, gathering insights on different law firms, and speaking to other candidates going through the process.</p>\n<p>Thank you SO much to you and the entire team for setting up the platform and making it such a fantastic resource. It was truly instrumental for me.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>DB</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p>Chloe was great, loved her!

This session on M&amp;A was particularly great. Vocalising the business concepts that I&#8217;ve been working through on paper is a perfect way to prepare for interviews, and this session on M&amp;As covered a range of those concepts &#8211; ranging from accessible to challenging. Jaysen and Alice are also perfect leaders. They give everyone enough time to express their views &#8211; whilst also providing useful advice, and spot-on explanations every single time that they speak. I get so much out of these sessions; they are one of the best interactive resources &#8211; if not the best &#8211; for aspiring lawyers that I&#8217;ve seen around.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>DR</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got the phone call from [redacted] this morning and I got offered the training contract!

I would recommend it to anyone with an upcoming interview/assessment centre or anyone who may have one in future and just wants to practice interview and commercial awareness questions. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>FT</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just wanted to say that I had my [redacted] assessment centre today and just found that I got a training contract on the same day!

Rachel reviewed my application, I received helpful feedback on my practice video interviews, Arun prepared me for the case study interview during the assessment centre and you, Jaysen, offered valuable words of advice on the forum/chat. Most importantly, though, the supportive forum community you have established and grown has made this whole process a lot more bearable.

After listening to graduate recruitment\u2019s feedback on each part of the assessment centre, it is safe to say that one of the best decisions I ever made was booking a mock interview with Arun. The weekly newsletters and the chat function have been tremendously helpful and encouraging since I joined TCLA in August 2020.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this being my first assessment centre and not having any other invites to interviews/assessment centres at present, I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel, all thanks to you guys.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you once again for all that you do.

The community has helped me with applications, interviews and assessment days! &#8230;I can go on and on about the benefits I\u2019ve received from TCLA but we would be here for months.\u00a0</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>KL</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have recently received a training contract offer from [redacted] and will be accepting the offer.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;TCLA has undoubtedly been instrumental in allowing me to unlock my true potential and iron out deficiencies in my all-round approach to the training contract process that had been holding me back for years.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I could not be happier with the service I have received and it is the best money I have ever spent.

I want to take time out to thank both of you for your extreme efforts to make the process a lot easier. It provided me with an insight into what I could expect at an assessment centre. Also, it made me realise how I can utilise my time further during the lockdown to increase my commercial awareness. The sessions enable me to apply my prior knowledge to scenarios and develop my team working skills virtually. It is incredibly useful receiving a guide after the session summarising the key points. It meant I could concentrate during the sessions and have a guide to look over and further my understanding to help me prepare for the real thing. I love hearing both of your experiences, especially Alice&#8217;s, regarding interviews and appreciate how you both provide tips throughout the sessions.

Jaysen\u2019s comments were so incisive and I was able to totally reconfigure my personal statement using his feedback.

Since last summer, I have been watching your webinars &#8211; they are easily the most pragmatic and genuinely helpful that I\u2019ve attended. More recently, I used your online course materials and found the Watson Glaser prep course especially useful. I have also dipped my toe into the forum and been so impressed by the friendliness and willingness to help of all its members.\u00a0</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>LL</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p>Arun is great!

I remember submitting a series of applications for review for my first-year schemes where I achieved some, but not widespread success. You were able to guide me in the right direction and I really worked hard to improve my applications.</p>\n<p>This year, you have provided invaluable feedback once again. Of the 9 applications I have submitted, 7 have been successful in passing the sift. I have got 2 Vacation Schemes lined up for the Summer, I have a further 3 AC\u2019s lined up to fill up whatever space I have left! I have even had to turn some WG\u2019s/AC\u2019s down.</p>\n<p>In that respect, I wanted to extend my thanks and gratitude. There is absolutely no way I would have achieved this if it were not for your assistance. Looking back at my initial applications, they were awful! You have been instrumental in my success.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>LT</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got a vacation scheme offer from [redacted]!!! Honestly I cannot thank you enough for all the help you and the TCLA team have given me. The confidence I got from the practice interview really helped with my actual interviews and the areas that I improved from your feedback were ones that the interviewer seemed really impressed with. TCLA has helped a ridiculous amount with my commercial awareness. I never felt confident answering commercial awareness questions until I found your page and it is the reason I failed at so many interviews in the past. As you know I literally gave up on the hope of getting any offers this year. I genuinely could not have done this without your help and cannot express how grateful I am to you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep doing what you are doing!\u00a0</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>LW</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p>I would like to thank you for everything.

The platform consists of detailed insights into law firms, practical advice and most importantly helpful individuals who are part of the wider team who willingly make themselves available within minutes to answer your questions and that is no exaggeration. The platform also provides several important information including videos and notes which deliver the breakdown of key commercial concepts and commercial awareness newsletters and many more.

I am Syrian-born and came to this country as a refugee and have grown up in a single-parent household.</p>\n<p>I found the TCLA scholarship through LinkedIn and decided to apply as I had plans to dedicate my spare time towards vacation scheme/training contract application. Immediately, I found my applications improved, especially with my first application resulting in a vacation scheme offer from a US firm! The resources available to me have helped me understand the ins and outs of what is required for a strong application. For example the past applications on the forums have offered me an insight into what graduate recruitment at firms are looking for specifically. Beyond this, I have received support for upcoming interviews directly from Jaysen which inevitably led to my early success.</p>\n<p>The courses that are available with the TCLA scholarship have developed my understanding of the practicalities of different strands of commercial/corporate law. For example, I have only just started learning about private equity and what this entails. Having no faith in my knowledge of the world of finance, this has strengthened my confidence in more ways than one. I would urge anyone who is looking to gain the upper hand in applications to apply for the TCLA scholarship!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\"  src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TCLA-Sharaf-Sheikh-400x300.jpg\"></div>\n                                        <cite><span>Sharaf Shiekha</span>Magic Circle Trainee - Class of 2020, TCLA Scholarship</cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p>For what it&#8217;s worth, the new premium content is brilliant.

First of all, knowing that I have a session coming up makes me motivated to keep up to date with the news which is already beneficial. Secondly, while I may think that I know something very well, when it comes to explaining it, I realise that I should read it into it more. So, this exercise has really helped me understand my strengths and weaknesses, and work towards improving the same. At the same time, since the first training session, I have been paying more attention to different concepts and terminologies in articles, and I am in a better position to have a conversation with someone on difficult topics. The structure of each session is great &#8211; &#8216;throwing&#8217; questions on each person can be quite challenging and it is also really useful listening to the perspective of other people in the session. The group exercise has also helped me improve the way I collaborate with my teammates. Apart from the great quality of the programme, I think what really differentiates this programme from other training tools, is the way you and Alice make the questions or raise additional points in the discussion. It may be challenging but it&#8217;s so friendly at the some time, and I feel encouraged to share my views, even though they may not be 100% correct. I am not afraid to make mistakes and that&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t find everywhere.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>SS</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\"  src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TCLA-Syeda-Rubab-Zahra-e1607445693224-400x300.jpg\">\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p>Honestly, the scholarship been such a massive help to me in making applications- I actually got two magic circle interview offers from the back of the help I received from the TCLA scholarship!</p>\n<p>The TCLA 2019 scholarship programme was invaluable when it came to helping me apply for vacation schemes and training contracts. Through utilising the courses offered by the programme, such as the &#8220;Legal Technology Crash Course&#8221; and the &#8220;M&amp;A Crash Course&#8221;, I now feel much more comfortable with legal topics I had previously been unsure about. TCLA&#8217;s law firm insights have helped me make tailored applications to firms, and have helped me increase the number of interviews I am being invited to. Their video interview simulator was also incredibly insightful. By using the simulator prior to an interview, I calmed my nerves down regarding the process while also receiving helpful feedback that helped me improve my video interviewing technique. Overall, the TCLA Scholarship has been a wonderful aid in helping me navigate the difficult process of applying for training contracts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\"  src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TCLA-Syeda-Rubab-Zahra-e1607445693224-400x300.jpg\"></div>\n                                        <cite><span>Syeda Rubab Zahra</span>Trainee Solicitor, International Law Firm, Class of 2020, TCLA Scholarship</cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p>I attended the training session.

The resources offered on the programme have benefited me in so many ways. Having access to the commercial awareness courses, introduction to the city course and premium forum has really benefited me in terms of becoming a more well-rounded law student and future vac scheme applicant. The team&#8217;s review of my application also made it easier for me to understand my (many!) mistakes and offered advice that was both supportive and critical. I have to say that without the scholarship and having the assistance from TCLA I would not have progressed as much as I have in my development as an aspiring commercial solicitor. If you meet the criteria, I would highly encourage you to apply!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\"  src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/download-400x300.png\"></div>\n                                        <cite><span>Yusuf Panah</span>Class of 2020, TCLA Scholarship</cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have been offered a TC by [redacted]!

I cannot thank Jaysen and Alice enough for their time and efforts.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n                                        <cite><span>AE</span></cite>\n                                    </blockquote>\n\n                                </div>\n                                \n                            </div>\n                            \n                            \n                            <div class=\"bottom-logo\">\n                                <img class=\"style-svg logo\" src=\"https://www.thecorporatelawacademy.com/wp-content/themes/tcla/dist/assets/images/tcla-logomark.svg\" />\n                            </div>\n                                \n                                \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                    \n        \n                <div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"column large-10 small-centered\">\n                        <div class=\"testimonial-quote\">\n                            \n                            <div class=\"testimonial-quote-inner\">\n                            \n                                <!--\n                                <div class=\"column large-4\">\n\n                                    <img class=\"hero\" >\n                                </div>\n                                -->\n\n\n                                <div class=\"column\">\n\n                                    <blockquote>\n                                        <p>Hi Jaysen,</p>\n<p>I hope you are well.</p>\n<p>I thought I would drop you a line to explain why I have decided to cancel my TCLA premium subscription, just in case you thought it was due to dissatisfaction with the service I have received. That is certainly not the case. Rather, I have recently received a training contract offer from Travers Smith and will be accepting the offer.</p>\n<p>When I started using TCLA premium earlier this year, I lacked a lot of confidence in my ability to write a convincing application, my ability to assimilate complex commercial topics and my all-round ability to navigate through the TC process in order to actually obtain an offer. However, I began to use TCLA premium for hours upon end each day throughout lockdown 1.0, from the law firm insights you provide in order to better tailor my apps to the various courses you offer aimed at demystifying the elusive notion of &#8216;commercial awareness&#8217; just to build up an arsenal of commercial aptitude that would leave me in good stead for AC&#8217;s and interviews, and my confidence began to dramatically swing in the other direction. I began to get past the application stage in the vast majority of my apps and I began to believe in my ability to perform exceptionally at the AC/interview stage. TCLA has undoubtedly been instrumental in allowing me to unlock my true potential and iron out deficiencies in my all-round approach to the TC process that had been holding me back for years.</p>\n<p>I could not be happier with the service I have received and it is the best money I have ever spent. Thank you for your relentless efforts to continuously provide such a first-class service that really does have the capability to change lives.</p>\n<p>All the best</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"small-centered\"><img class=\"hero\" ></div>\n

training contract offer, first of all, I know the feeling. And I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ve seen the application process become more competitive than ever, and I have met so many candidates in the last cycle who have really put their heart into this process, only to face rejection.\nOr maybe you\u2019re just starting out, and you see the people around you talking about vacation schemes and training contracts. It\u2019s stressful when you find out law firms are receiving 4,000 applications for 25 places. How are you supposed to know where to even begin?\nAt TCLA, we\u2019re here to help. We give you personalised coaching and training to help you get a training contract.\nWe look forward to meeting you soon.\nThe UK\u2019s biggest community of rising corporate legal stars\nMeet a community of over 20,000 aspiring lawyers, future trainee solicitors and graduate recruiters, receive advice on how to become a successful candidate, and build your confidence, skills and knowledge to excel as a commercial lawyer.\nWall of Fame\nA snapshot from thousands of aspiring lawyers...\nMahesh was incredible! I cannot thank him (and TCLA) enough for offering this service.\nAB\nSpecifically, Mahesh began the interview by asking exactly what I hoped to improve and gave targeted feedback at the end of each question. The interview didn\u2019t feel intimidating at all and was very well tailored towards the firm I am applying for. At the same time, the questions were challenging enough to be useful and thought provoking. Mahesh also gave insight into tailoring interview answers to different types of firms (ie. US vs UK). This mock interview had so much value and I feel much confident going into my upcoming interviews.\nABWhen I initially saw the case study I was a little bit scared. It looked quite complicated and like something I wouldn\u2019t be able to answer. Jaysen and Alice encouraged us to say what we think as \u201cwe will only get marked on what we say\u201d. This gave me the confidence to communicate my thoughts in a safe environment. I tried my best to incorporate my feedback from my last session which I also found extremely helpful. I really enjoyed how relatable Jaysen and Alice made the case study. I know with practice and the guidance of Alice and Jaysen, I will continue to making progress and hopefully learn to articulate my ideas better/\nI have just received a training contract offer from [redacted] (my dream firm) and I just wanted to write to you to say a big THANK YOU for creating this platform and being so supportive.\nBefore this cycle, I was very lost with my applications and did not really know what I was doing wrong. In retrospect, I didn\u2019t know that much about what makes a good application and commercial awareness seemed like a scary and unattainable concept. Throughout this year, I did your courses, read discussions, aside questions, wrote applications, started reading FT news and suddenly it all started fitting together and I was even praised for my commercial awareness\u2026\nThis platform gave me the confidence that I can do this (even through I probably did not believe it until it actually happened) and the power to push through the months of applications and interviews.\nI wanted to let you know how much I appreciate what you are doing. I appreciate what you are doing. I realise that this is not just the work of one person and the strength of TCLA lies in the community of incredibly supportive and ambitious people.\nAC\nI don\u2019t honestly believe I would have got the TC offer without Arun\u2019s help and guidance \u2013 I am incredibly happy I spent the money on the sessions. He was encouraging, explained things brilliantly well and most importantly gave me the boost of confidence I needed before the virtual AC. Both the questions asked in the mock interview and the case study prep were incredibly relevant and tailored to me. I have already recommended it to several people and will continue to do so! Thanks again Arun \ud83d\ude42\nAE\nMahesh has been absolutely fantastic. I have been having weekly interviews with him in preparation for Winter Vacation Schemes and Training Contract interviews. He has been incredibly invested in my process, is extremely friendly and approachable and more importantly went above and beyond to help me secure my training contract. Thank you very much Mahesh!\nAG\nI\u2019m absolutely thrilled to let you know that I have accepted a TC offer from [redacted]. It feels surreal to be a future trainee at one of my top choice firms and I couldn\u2019t have got to where I am without TCLA.\nI started this process around 18 months ago, a couple of weeks after I graduated. I remember my first open day at Latham & Watkins \u2013 I did not understand a single technical term that was mentioned, whether that be loan covenants or the lifecycle of a PE investment. But the day piqued my interest and I met Alice, who later introduced me to TCLA. I was amazed \u2013 I found a community who shared my goal and a wealth of resources. TCLA accelerated my progress, helping me to secure VS at [redacted] and [redacted], something I never thought was possible. And a few months later, I finally have the TC.\nAG\n[Redacted] offered me a training contract on Friday!!!\nGoing from CCD with no mitigating circumstances to receiving 4 vacation scheme offers and now a training contract offer is a story that I definitely want heard. This is especially the case because I ALWAYS hear stories about people who doubt whether they can make it in this field because their A-Level grades aren\u2019t great and/or they went to a non-Russell group uni, so I am definitely happy for it to be posted in hopes of inspiring those people.\nThe fact that I am going to be a trainee in 4 months as well makes this even crazier!\nAs you know, my journey has been a rollercoaster, so I can\u2019t even put my excitement into words right now. I just wanted to say a HUGE thank you because this would not have been possible without all of your help!\nAP\nGreat session! Arun adjusted the questions to suit the type of interview I was having. He asked difficult questions I wouldn\u2019t have thought to study. He also provided good general tips about structuring my answers. Overall, the session made me feel more prepared heading into my interview.\nBA\nI\u2019m delighted to share with you that I received a TC offer at [redacted] in London that evening!\n\u2026I just wanted to send a huge thank you your way for every ounce of help you\u2019ve provided along the way, especially for your first-rate application reviews.\nTCLA really is an incredible platform, right through from the weekly commercial awareness updates to the extremely insightful content you\u2019ve created within the Premium service. It\u2019s been a genuine pleasure to watch the company grow\u2026There truly is no other service on the market that comes close to what you\u2019ve built, and I will without question continue to recommend TCLA to anyone looking to stand out in such a competitive recruitment cycle.\nBA\nThank you so much for coming to Bristol on the 10th December. I really enjoyed your presentation and meeting you in person. You are a huge inspiration to me as you\u2019re not only a successful law applicant but an entrepreneur with a social purpose. You and the TCLA team help so many people \u2013 it is unbelievable. I hope the TCLA project expands in the future and fulfils your dreams. The TCLA community has been THE MOST supportive thing out there for me during my time in Law School (and it should help during my job hunt after graduation).\nBC\nBGOne of the best interactive sessions I have attended by far. Closely simulates a real assessment environment with regards to the structure, the content and the questions asked. Even though I found it challenging, I learnt a lot and it gave me confidence to face and prepare for my real upcoming assessments. This is a perfect way to prepare for interviews and case studies going forward and the membership is worth every penny! Jaysen and Alice provide the perfect balance between them while both providing informative information and personal advice to takeaway from the session. One piece of constructive feedback is that I wish the sessions were either longer or slightly smaller groups as I didn\u2019t want it to end.\nWanted to write you this email to let you know I\u2019ve got a place on the [redacted] Summer Internship. I finished an hour ago and they just rang me and I can\u2019t believe it.\nI just wanted to say thank you. Thank you so much for taking a chance on me for the Brand Ambassador role, I was in a really difficult place at the time but you gave me the confidence to be able to realise that a career in commercial law is possible for me and without you I wouldn\u2019t have got the other opportunities I have.\nBT\nI\u2019m not sure whether you will remember this, but we had a conversation over the phone a couple of months ago. I mentioned that I was working at [redacted], had undertaken a few vacation schemes and was especially nervous about my upcoming vacation scheme at [redacted]. We discussed the feedback from my previous scheme with [redacted] and ways to improve, at which point you suggested practicing the case study on TCLA and scheduling a mock interview with Arun Sohan-Pall.\nIt\u2019s been a few months since that conversation\u2026and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased to let you know that after completing the virtual vacation scheme at [redacted], I was offered a training contract!!! Thank you so much to you for speaking to me back then and giving me the confidence to give the scheme my best shot.\nI have been using TCLA since 2018 and have utilised both the application review service and the mock interview with Arun. I can attest to the quality of both, as well as the TCLA platform more generally. It was so useful when it came to preparing for upcoming assessment centres, gathering insights on different law firms, and speaking to other candidates going through the process.\nThank you SO much to you and the entire team for setting up the platform and making it such a fantastic resource. It was truly instrumental for me.\nDB\nChloe was great, loved her! I liked the fact that she gave honest and to the point feedback straight after each question. She helped me understand what I needed to improve in my approach.\nDaniele\nA week ago, I accepted a training contract offer with [redacted].\nAs a career changer and a BME female with little to no contacts in commercial law, TCLA gave me the knowledge and resources I needed to improve my applications and achieve my goal. TCLA\u2019s posts on Instagram gave me the confidence to own my journey, background and setbacks with honesty, and I know that this was instrumental in me getting a training contract offer. At every occasion when I needed help, you went above and beyond to ensure that I was supported.\nThank you so much for your time, attention and effort \u2013 I truly could not have done this without you or TCLA.\nDH\nI received and accepted a training contract offer from [redacted] today!\nJust wanted to thank you for creating TCLA and providing a platform where people can improve their applications and commercial awareness!\nI don\u2019t think I would have gotten a training contract offer without TCLA and definitely hope TCLA can become a school in the future!\nDP\nDRAs someone who struggles to confidently express my thoughts on commercial concepts, I always find these sessions so helpful; they offer a perfectly balanced combination of encouragement, commercial insights, and useful advice. This session on M&A was particularly great. Vocalising the business concepts that I\u2019ve been working through on paper is a perfect way to prepare for interviews, and this session on M&As covered a range of those concepts \u2013 ranging from accessible to challenging. Jaysen and Alice are also perfect leaders. They give everyone enough time to express their views \u2013 whilst also providing useful advice, and spot-on explanations every single time that they speak. I get so much out of these sessions; they are one of the best interactive resources \u2013 if not the best \u2013 for aspiring lawyers that I\u2019ve seen around.\nI got the phone call from [redacted] this morning and I got offered the training contract! Still feel like I\u2019m dreaming, I\u2019ve checked my call log about 100 times.\nThank you so much for all the hard work that you\u2019ve put into TCLA \u2013 giving me the opportunity to be brand ambassador last year has opened so many doors for me and made me believe that I was capable of becoming a commercial lawyer. TCLA premium was absolutely key to my success, I spent so long on the site this summer and it gave me everything I needed for the vacation scheme.\n\u2026I can\u2019t wait to see TCLA go far!\nDS\nMahesh was very thorough in his approach \u2013 more than other mentors I have to say. I have learnt really a LOT in just one session. Incredible value. He will definitely be my first choice for mentorship in the future.\nDT\nArun was really personable and made me feel at ease. I felt that the session was really structured and well thought out and I received invaluable feedback and confidence which really prepared me for my interview. I have since gained an interview for the second round stage for a training contract and I would definitely use the service again and would also recommend this to anyone who is applying! Thanks again \ud83d\ude42\nDT\nAfter years (!!!) applications, interviews, ACs and, ultimately, rejections I was offered a Summer Internship at [redacted]. The Partner who delivered the news said I was the top performer among all (40!) candidates they had that day.\nI am still pinching myself, speechless it\u2019s all coming together. I can\u2019t thank you (and the entire TCLA community) enough for all the tips and assistance along the way!\nDT\nEALoved how intimate the sessions were and how interactive it was. I thought we\u2019d mainly be listening and taking notes but it was the opposite which meant I gained way more out of the session than expected! It was by far the most useful workshop I\u2019ve ever attended (online and offline). I can\u2019t fault it at all. The only thing I would say is that I wish it ran on longer, only because I was really enjoying it and wanted it to continue. Also, please keep doing more of these!!\nSince I have been using TCLA resources from September 2019, my applications and interviews at law firms have taken an absolute U-turn in terms of success. Having previously experienced nothing but rejections for two years, this year I secured 5 vacation scheme offers at elite US firms and today signed my training contract with [redacted] to commence in 2021!\nI just wanted to thank all the top contributors to TCLA for some top-drawer insights and sage advice. Personally, I found the \u2018Becoming an Exceptional Candidate\u2019 course particularly useful in terms of changing my mindset approaching assessment centres and it has evidently paid off!\nThanks again and keep doing what you\u2019re doing!\nEK\nJust wanted to reach out and personally thank you for the invaluable work you do running and coordinating TCLA. After a string of unsuccessful apps last year, I put my head down this summer and started working more systematically towards achieving a vac scheme offer (a methodological approach really is the key here isn\u2019t it). TCLA has been absolutely central in that process and I\u2019m now so pleased to say I\u2019ve been offered a place on a VS at a silver circle firm this summer.\nI know you probably hear from people about this all the time, but it feels important to tell you the time and energy you have spent on your business has definitely contributed to changing my trajectory in such a hugely positive way. There\u2019s no small way of properly saying thank you so much for that.\nES\nI still can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m typing this, but I\u2019m so happy to have accepted a training contract at an international firm that feels so right for me!\n\u2026Whilst I worked incredibly hard to get here \u2013 spending time self-reflecting on my skills and increasing my commercial awareness, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible at all without this community. You guys made me feel so much less alone in this process, and the support you provide to others is invaluable. I\u2019m heavily indebted to TCLA. Jaysen, thank you from the bottom of my heart for creating this platform, and thank you to all the heart for creating this platform, and thank you to all the amazing people who contribute and make it what it is. Without you guys I wouldn\u2019t be here.\nET\nIt was an extremely beneficial and insightful session. I gained a lot from it and it made me more confident for the real interview. The only regret I have is having more time with Mahesh \u2013 he is truly brilliant as a trainer/mentor!\nFD\nMahesh was again brilliant at providing true and constructive feedback, giving practical pointers on how to improve, suggestions and other tips. Worth every minute!\nFD\nJaysen is one of the most knowledgeable and friendliest advisors working in this field! His advice is clear and simple and he shows real understanding of a candidate\u2019s strengths/weaknesses. I cannot recommend him enough. My best wishes, F\nFezanFezan, Paralegal at MC firm\nThanks for all the help, wouldn\u2019t have got to this stage without you helping to get my application perfect!\nI got it! Received a call yesterday with very positive feedback! I\u2019m sooooooo happy! Thank you Jaysen!\nI wanted to let you know that I secured a TC with [redacted]. Thank you again for all your help and support.\nThe assessment day went really well and I got a training contract offer on the same day! Just wanted to say thank you so much for the helpful feedback and advice!\nFF\nI just wanted to drop a thank you for your hard work over the last couple of months, and over the course of my application journey. I remember submitting a series of applications for review for my first-year schemes where I achieved some, but not widespread success. You were able to guide me in the right direction and I really worked hard to improve my applications.\nThis year, you have provided invaluable feedback once again. Of the 9 applications I have submitted, 7 have been successful in passing the sift. I have gotten 2 vacation schemes lined up for the summer, and have a further 3 ACs lined up to fill whatever space I have left! I have even had to turn some WG\u2019s/AC\u2019s down.\n\u2026I wanted to extend my thanks and gratitude. There is absolutely no way I would have achieved this if it were not for your assistance. Looking back at my initial applications, they were awful! You have been instrumental in my success.\nFL\nJaysen is one of the most knowledgeable and friendliest advisors working in this field! His advice is clear and simple and he shows real understanding of a candidate\u2019s strengths/weaknesses. I cannot recommend him enough. My best wishes, FFezan\nI feel it incumbent on me to let you know how thankful I am for TCLA\u2019s excellent service.\nToday I\u2019ve just been offered a training contract by [redacted] and I will certainly be accepting. However, this task has been made substantially easier by the service that TCLA offers,\nJust to give you some context, back in January I had an assessment centre for a vacation scheme at [redacted] and it went terribly. I just froze in the interview, having no idea what all the technical jargon on the case study meant. I was hugely disappointed, but I dusted myself off and carried on\u2026Rather speculatively, I decided to apply for a training contract at [redacted], got the interview, and somehow secured the training contract.\nFM\nThe new premium content is brilliant. Arun-Sohan Pall\u2019s discussion on substantive and procedural commercial awareness is the sort of insight you don\u2019t see elsewhere. TCLA provide the best combination of tools and knowledge to equip the next generation of lawyers on the market, and I want to thank you for that!\nFN\nI have received 2 training contract offers from [redacted]. I am truly grateful to the TCLA community and you. From being chosen as one of the commercial news writers to practising with Arun for both the vacation scheme and training contract interview, TCLA truly has been indispensable to my training contract journey and personal development. I remember the many calls I had with you during those \u201coffice\u201d hours and all the encouragement you gave me.\nFR\nI\u2019m so happy to say that following my vacation scheme with [redacted], I have been offered a training contract with the firm!\nI was awarded a TCLA scholarship this year and it has been so so helpful when preparing for my vacation scheme and increasing my commercial awareness. I really couldn\u2019t have done it without your resources/workshop/courses and I am so grateful!\nFP\nThe mocks were extremely helpful both in terms of content feedback and boosting confidence. Arun gave broad general and specific personalised advice. Some questions were challenging and this prepared me well for the real interviews. There was a lot of flexibility to cover what I wanted to focus on. I would recommend it to anyone with an upcoming interview/assessment centre or anyone who may have one in future and just wants to practice interview and commercial awareness questions.\nFT\nI just wanted to say that I had my [redacted] assessment centre today and just found that I got a training contract on the same day! I honestly couldn\u2019t have done it without the TCLA courses, especially the virtual sessions, case studies and the mock interviews with Arun \u2013 all are such valuable services and you offer a fantastic platform for aspiring lawyers!\nFY\nYou are the only person that has actually made me feel confident about my application technique and that with a few adjustments I may stand a chance of a vacation scheme with a firm I would really like to be at \u2013 thank you for that!\nThe way you word your advice comes across as friendly and helpful, as opposed to some who have come across as quite patronising and made me feel like I shouldn\u2019t even bother submitting the application. I am currently sitting for the LPC and haven\u2019t, as of yet, completed a vacation scheme with any firm. Your feedback has given me the confidence that I need to understand that my experience thus far is enough. Thank you again!\nGH\nI want to thank you for TCLA\u2019s amazing support throughout my journey towards the training contract. In June, I signed my contract with my dream firm from the very beginning [redacted] \u2013 for a training contract starting [redacted] and could not be more grateful for everything TCLA has done for me in the past year.\nStarting off with your truly outstanding webinars\u2026and the fantastic M&A Bootcamp, which taught me so many new concepts and changed the way of approaching M&A scenarios; then, once working on my training contract application, TCLA helped me throughout all stages on the way. Rachel reviewed my application, I received helpful feedback on my practice video interviews, Arun prepared me for the case study interview during the assessment centre and you, Jaysen, offered valuable words of advice on the forum/chat. Most importantly, though, the supportive forum community you have established and grown has made this whole process a lot more bearable. Random people congratulating, answering questions, caring for each other \u2013 this is so special and I hope you will all continue this truly remarkable work.\nGK\nJust wanted to thank you for creating TCLA \u2013 it\u2019s been an incredible help throughout the law application process. A year and a half ago, I knew nothing about a legal career and felt incredibly daunted even going into a City law firm. Numerous rejections later and I\u2019ve now secured two vacation schemes \u2013 still not sure how I\u2019ve done it, but without all of the invaluable resources provided by TCLA I wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance! Just wanted to tell you to keep on doing what you\u2019re doing and changing lives!\nGL\nThe interview prep provided was very useful and tailored to my situation. The process of helping me improve on my answers and picking holes in my examples definitely helped me secure a TC. Hands down the best interview prep I have received and will definitely be referring people to do the same!\nGM\nI am incredibly proud of, and inspired by what you are building with TCLA.\nI have periodic calls with students applying for vacation schemes and training contracts and TCLA constantly comes up as a community and platform that has become a lifeline for so many students in the challenging journey towards the career of their dreams.\n\u2026I know you have only just begun and there\u2019s so much greatness ahead for you and fr TCLA. I am excited for you.\nWell done Jaysen and thank you for all that you do to make a difference!\nGP\nI cried for hours earlier tonight because I cannot believe what had happened. Today, I got offered a training contract from [redacted]. I\u2019m still trying to process it all \u2013 I\u2019ve been overwhelmed with emotions!\nWhen I started this journey in search of a training contract, I had no clue what I was doing. And that was very clear. I never got past the application stage and I could never tell what I was doing wrong, especially as no feedback was given. It was only with your help this cycle that I started to see results\u2026Your mock interviews truly prepared me for [my interviews].\nOn top of this, I thank you for creating the TCLA community. The people there are incredibly nice and always willing to help and give advice. I don\u2019t think I would have ever made it without your help. This all feels very surreal and I cannot believe that I have done it. I cannot thank you enough for how much you have helped me through this rollercoaster of a journey.\nGR\nJust wanted to say thank you for everything! Last year, at this time, all I had was the resources available on TCLA. I didn\u2019t feel confident in myself but stuck to the advice. I reached out to others to network, used the vac interview prep resources and started to follow commercial news more rigorously. Literally, this time last year!\nNow I have a training contract offer and I\u2019m getting to start the career I\u2019ve always wanted but never believed I was capable of. Thank you for everything!\nHE\nI just wanted to tell you that I have just been called by [redacted] and they offered me a training contract directly, without needing to go through their vacation scheme!!\nI wanted to thank you for your help, the mock interview really made me feel so much more confident and definitely contributed to my success during the interview!\n\u2026You are truly an amazing person and everybody can see your passion for helping other students get into their dream firm!\nThank you again!\nHF\nAll the best with all this \u2013 You have become a true inspiration for me and if I ever get in a position where I can make the kind of difference you are making it will be because of you.\nIbtisam ArifIbtisam Arif, Student\nReally well conducted and definitely worth the time and money investment as it increased my confidence. The feedback has been really useful for me to improve upon.\nIG\nI have had 3 sessions with Mahesh over the past week, and each of them have been invaluable in giving me the confidence and structure to ace my assessment centre. I am grateful to Mahesh for his amazing feedback, guidance and attention. Really top notch.\nJE\nI recently heard back from [redacted] following my assessment centre with them. They rejected me. Their feedback essentially said \u2018had you applied for a vacation scheme this would\u2019ve been a different conversation\u2019 (since I applied for a direct training contract).\nAs disheartening as that was, I just wanted to express my immense gratitude to TCLA for making me feel \u2018normal\u2019 and helping me come to terms with the fact that this process really isn\u2019t fair. After listening to graduate recruitment\u2019s feedback on each part of the assessment centre, it is safe to say that one of the best decisions I ever made was booking a mock interview with Arun. The weekly newsletters and the chat function have been tremendously helpful and encouraging since I joined TCLA in August 2020.\nDespite this being my first assessment centre and not having any other invites to interviews/assessment centres at present, I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel, all thanks to you guys.\nThank you once again for all that you do. I\u2019m sure I speak for a lot of people when I say this, but it really is the reason a lot of us are (or at least I am) still standing.\nI can\u2019t wait for the day I email you to say that I have been made an offer!\nJP\nThe feedback Mahesh gave was very specific to my answers (unlike University career services which I have found give vague responses) and he gave clear guidance on how to improve. I also feel significantly more confident for my upcoming interview based on the experience.\nJS\nArun took time to understand my up to date experiences and then tailored the interview to my needs and worries. I was glad that it wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t about answering preset questions but rather about getting deep into issues I could encounter in the real interview; it helped me to gain the confidence I needed! Thank you.\nJT\nHi Jaysen,\nI hope you are well. Just wanted to say thank you so much for all of your help as I was offered a place on the CMS vac scheme following my assessment centre!\nThe mock interview you set up for me and the CLA in general, were by far the most useful resources I used when preparing (even compared to my University\u2019s career service) so thanks again!\nKavi\nKaviKavi, Future CMS vac schemer\nHi Jaysen,\nI hope you are well. Just wanted to say thank you so much for all of your help as I was offered a place on the CMS vac scheme following my assessment centre!\nThe mock interview you set up for me and the CLA in general, were by far the most useful resources I used when preparing (even compared to my University\u2019s career service) so thanks again!\nKavi\nKavi\nThanks for your help with the practice interview, and to let you know that I got the [redacted] training contract! I\u2019m really, really pleased (and relieved!), after so many rejections and years of applying it feels great and I\u2019m so happy I pushed through and persevered. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less about rejections now!\nKL\n\u2026Yesterday evening, I was offered a training contract with my dream firm, [redacted]. I am still in complete shock as I didn\u2019t think this day would come to me. I remember myself talking myself out of applying to the firm last year as I convinced myself that it was \u201cabove my reach\u201d. I saw a TCLA post that read, \u201call it takes is one yes\u201d and I held on to that line ever since \u2013 wow still can\u2019t believe this!\nI want to thank you [Jaysen] and the amazing TCLA community for the valuable resources on that platform. The community has helped me with applications, interviews and assessment days! \u2026I can go on and on about the benefits I\u2019ve received from TCLA but we would be here for months.\nKL\nI have recently received a training contract offer from [redacted] and will be accepting the offer.\n\u2026TCLA has undoubtedly been instrumental in allowing me to unlock my true potential and iron out deficiencies in my all-round approach to the training contract process that had been holding me back for years.\nI could not be happier with the service I have received and it is the best money I have ever spent. Thank you for your relentless efforts to continuously provide such a first-class service that really does have the capability to change lives.\nKM\nI\u2019ve applied to 6 law firms and all 6 have invited me to an interview! Again I know that my applications were all strong because of TCLA!! So thank you so much!\nKN\nSo [redacted] got back to me a lot sooner than expected and they offered me a training contract!!!\nAfter 3 cycles I\u2019m still in disbelief but I\u2019m very happy.\nI also wanted to say a big thank you to both of you for all your help! It\u2019s been a long 3 years and I\u2019ve had moments where I\u2019ve felt like the training contract would never happen but TCLA has been a huge help in keeping me going. I honestly don\u2019t think I would be in this position without you guys\u2026I\u2019m a non-law graduate with no contacts in the industry so TCLA\u2019s courses, newsletters and training sessions have been invaluable.\nLH\nLKStarting the journey towards securing a training contract is scary because I did not know what to expect. I want to take time out to thank both of you for your extreme efforts to make the process a lot easier. It provided me with an insight into what I could expect at an assessment centre. Also, it made me realise how I can utilise my time further during the lockdown to increase my commercial awareness. The sessions enable me to apply my prior knowledge to scenarios and develop my team working skills virtually. It is incredibly useful receiving a guide after the session summarising the key points. It meant I could concentrate during the sessions and have a guide to look over and further my understanding to help me prepare for the real thing. I love hearing both of your experiences, especially Alice\u2019s, regarding interviews and appreciate how you both provide tips throughout the sessions. Once again, Thank you!\nThank you for everything you are doing at TCLA. I used your application review service for my recent application to [redacted] and, a couple of weeks ago, they called to let me know I got the training contract!\nThe review had a huge, direct impact on my application. Jaysen\u2019s comments were so incisive and I was able to totally reconfigure my personal statement using his feedback. By the time I sent off my statement, I felt like it was selling me in the most effective way possible, which gave me confidence going into later stages in the process.\nHowever, the application review is only one of many ways in which TCLA has been beneficial to me this year. Since last summer, I have been watching your webinars \u2013 they are easily the most pragmatic and genuinely helpful that I\u2019ve attended. More recently, I used your online course materials and found the Watson Glaser prep course especially useful. I have also dipped my toe into the forum and been so impressed by the friendliness and willingness to help of all its members.\nLL\nArun is great! He picks relevant case studies and helps you prepare holistically. You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll definitely be more confident going into your interviews after preparing with Arun.\nLO\nThe mock was a great interview refresher and it was monumental in my preparation to secure a late-summer vacation scheme (rescheduled due to Covid-19). Subsequently, I received a training contract offer at a top 20 firm commencing in 2021, as well as a full sponsorship for the LPC/LLM course. Thank you Arun and The Corporate Law Academy Team. Keep up the good work!\nLT\nI just wanted to drop you a thank you for your hard work over the last couple of months, and over the course of my application journey. I remember submitting a series of applications for review for my first-year schemes where I achieved some, but not widespread success. You were able to guide me in the right direction and I really worked hard to improve my applications.\nThis year, you have provided invaluable feedback once again. Of the 9 applications I have submitted, 7 have been successful in passing the sift. I have got 2 Vacation Schemes lined up for the Summer, I have a further 3 AC\u2019s lined up to fill up whatever space I have left! I have even had to turn some WG\u2019s/AC\u2019s down.\nIn that respect, I wanted to extend my thanks and gratitude. There is absolutely no way I would have achieved this if it were not for your assistance. Looking back at my initial applications, they were awful! You have been instrumental in my success.\nLT\nI got a vacation scheme offer from [redacted]!!! Honestly I cannot thank you enough for all the help you and the TCLA team have given me. The confidence I got from the practice interview really helped with my actual interviews and the areas that I improved from your feedback were ones that the interviewer seemed really impressed with. TCLA has helped a ridiculous amount with my commercial awareness. I never felt confident answering commercial awareness questions until I found your page and it is the reason I failed at so many interviews in the past. As you know I literally gave up on the hope of getting any offers this year. I genuinely could not have done this without your help and cannot express how grateful I am to you.\nKeep doing what you are doing!\nLW\nI would like to thank you for everything. I went to the TCLA Crash Course and I\u2019m a Premium Member. I can\u2019t even begin to explain how helpful it has all been.\nI applied to six firms and I have received interviews with all six of them. I can tell you with 110% certainty that \u2013 beyond my grades \u2013 that was all down to TCLA.\nNB\nThe mock was super useful- I found it to be challenging but those challenging elements were exactly what helped me perform well during my actual interview. I would recommend it to anyone with an assessment centre or interview coming up!\nNN\nMahesh answered all of the questions I had in mind concisely and in depth. I appreciated his honest and straight forward approach in providing feedback that was constructive in order to improve my answers and performance. I also thought it was great that he pointed out how I spoke as the way I come across is also important in the interview.\nOBE\nThis was an immensely valuable experience. Mahesh knows just how much further to push, and we were able to get to areas that I wasn\u2019t entirely confident about. The feedback was on point- we went for a model of feedback immediately after an answer- and this helped quite a lot as I was able to incorporate it into subsequent answers.\nTo briefly sum it up, the experience, like everything else at TCLA, exceeded all expectations.\nOL\nA few months ago I secured a training contract with [redacted]!\nI have been applying for training contracts to no avail for about three years but then came across TCLA about a year ago. The commercial awareness updates you run helped me massively with topics I previously struggled to get my head around. A week before my assessment centre I then signed up to TCLA Premium (to be honest I should have signed up much sooner). I took a week off work and spent the entire time pouring over the content.\nIt was hands down the best decision\u2026I recommended TCLA to those pursuing training contracts before securing my training contract and continue to do so now!\nOM\nYou probably don\u2019t remember but in March this year we had a mock interview for my vacation scheme interview with [redacted]. Fast forward to last week (and I cannot believe I am typing this), I received a training contract offer!!! As an international student from a non-RG university, this seemed like a very unrealistic dream a couple of years ago.\nI wanted to thank you and say how grateful I am for all of the help I have received from the TCLA community. I would not have been here if it wasn\u2019t for all the advice, guides and seminars you have put together. Not to mention the helpful threads on the forum. You have truly changed my life!\nOP\n\u2026TCLA has helped me boundlessly in my search for a training contract. The online courses and weekly newsletters were instrumental in building my commercial awareness and confidence for tackling assessment centres. They are interesting, accessible and extremely useful\u2026\nJaysen, you have been an incredible and generous point of contact for me since I started searching for a career in law. Your advice has been invaluable and I seriously cannot thank you enough. Your practice interviews were vital for learning the process and how to make the most of my experiences\u2026\nThe community you have developed on the TCLA forum is unique\u2026To have the input from a graduate recruitment specialist is so constructive; Jessica is always on hand with important advice and support. The same goes for Daniel and Alice whose experiences and advice I always find comforting and informative.\nThe work you are doing is unbelievable and there is nothing better than seeing TCLA grow and succeed in such an outstanding way\u2026\nI cannot thank you and tell you how much I appreciate everything you have done for me enough.\nOS\nI wanted to share with you that I was successful in the partner interview and I have been offered a training contract for [redacted]. I\u2019m over the moon!\nI wanted to thank you wholeheartedly for your help this year. You have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of the recruitment process as well as honing my commercial awareness throughout. I definitely became a better candidate thanks to TCLA!\nI loved the session with you and Alice. As a teacher myself, I was really impressed by how well structured and how encouraging you were. The questions you had prepared for us were wide-ranging both in terms of the difficulty level as well as the actual approach to the subject itself. As such, the session was challenging without being overwhelming and highly engaging. The fact that we then received a report of our performance and a summary of the topic itself is just incredible!\nOW\nThank you for all the amazing work you have and are doing. I saw your genuine interest and effort into helping me when you kindly interviewed me for [redacted] and this has been showcased throughout all the services that TCLA offers. Honestly, hats off to what the platform has become \u2013 I am rooting for you to transform the TCLA into a law school (fingers crossed)!\nPK\nI am absolutely buzzing to let you know I\u2019ve been offered a training contract offer with [redacted] (and an assessment centre still pending with [redacted] in February)!\nThank you for believing in me!\nI cannot wait to see where TCLA will go in the coming years and I hope to contribute as much as possible to the platform\u2026\nPN\nI cannot believe I get to write this but I got a training contract at [redacted]. I really couldn\u2019t have done any of this without you and the TCLA community. You really helped me identify where I needed to focus on and how to approach all the different stages with confidence. On several occasions, you went above and beyond a subscription service and I am SO thankful for that and all the time you have dedicated to helping me. I literally went from nothing to 4 vacation scheme offers, then to a training contract and having to turn down interviews. That is literally insane! I just feel really grateful to you and the TCLA community.\nPR\nFollowing my virtual vacation scheme I have been offered a training contract at [redacted] and I know this would not have been possible without the help of TCLA. Thank you so so much!!!\nYou have created such a wonderful space for aspiring lawyers to interact amongst each other, and I have really appreciated the support that everyone has offered me throughout my first application cycle. The resources you have created (particularly the 175+ questions bank) was immensely helpful, and I cannot thank you enough for the time you have invested in this website. Thank you again!\nRD\nChloe is fantastic! She made sure I got the most out of the session and was incredibly helpful. She asked tough questions and then provided insightful feedback on areas for improvement.\nRobert\nRSThe zoom session has thankfully restored my confidence in my ability to perform in case study exercises! I usually dread case studies exercises during assessment centres, but the session has showed me that you will go far from articulating your thought processes clearly. Thank you very much! Would highly recommend this to anyone with upcoming AC\u2019s!\nThe tools on TCLA are second to none. They have allowed me to understand not just what knowledge is required of me during this process but has also given me the information needed. Jaysen is dedicated to keeping the courses up to date with current topics and the video presentations have been a great help.\nAll in all, TCLA has introduced me to a world I didn\u2019t know existed. There is such great support available on the forum via people\u2019s experiences and updates through the process which is held together by the foundation that Jaysen provides through the courses and application reviews.\nCouldn\u2019t recommend more!\nSamar AlamTrainee Solicitor, Class of 2020, TCLA Scholarship\nI highly recommend the TCLA platform. It is probably one of, if not the best platform that provides practical resources that will aid your journey and pursuits into a career in corporate law. The platform consists of detailed insights into law firms, practical advice and most importantly helpful individuals who are part of the wider team who willingly make themselves available within minutes to answer your questions and that is no exaggeration. The platform also provides several important information including videos and notes which deliver the breakdown of key commercial concepts and commercial awareness newsletters and many more. I am truly grateful to have received a scholarship for the TCLA and I highly recommend that all aspiring commercial lawyers do join as soon as they can.\nSarah BamideleClass of 2020, TCLA Scholarship\nIt was very informative. Mahesh gave me really useful tips and insights into my interview performance and how I could improve it before my interview.\nSB\nMahesh carried out a thorough, and challenging mock interview. This really helped me with my upcoming interview, and my feedback enabled me to focus on specific areas of improvement. This was ultimately invaluable, particularly as some of the more challenging mock questions were asked in my interview!\nSB\nMy name is Sharaf and I graduated from the University of East Anglia in 2019 with a 2.1 degree in Law. I am Syrian-born and came to this country as a refugee and have grown up in a single-parent household.\nI found the TCLA scholarship through LinkedIn and decided to apply as I had plans to dedicate my spare time towards vacation scheme/training contract application. Immediately, I found my applications improved, especially with my first application resulting in a vacation scheme offer from a US firm! The resources available to me have helped me understand the ins and outs of what is required for a strong application. For example the past applications on the forums have offered me an insight into what graduate recruitment at firms are looking for specifically. Beyond this, I have received support for upcoming interviews directly from Jaysen which inevitably led to my early success.\nThe courses that are available with the TCLA scholarship have developed my understanding of the practicalities of different strands of commercial/corporate law. For example, I have only just started learning about private equity and what this entails. Having no faith in my knowledge of the world of finance, this has strengthened my confidence in more ways than one. I would urge anyone who is looking to gain the upper hand in applications to apply for the TCLA scholarship!\nSharaf ShiekhaMagic Circle Trainee - Class of 2020, TCLA Scholarship\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the new premium content is brilliant. Arun-Sohan Pall\u2019s discussion on substantive and procedural commercial awareness is the sort of insight you don\u2019t see elsewhere. TCLA provide the best combination of tools and knowledge to equip the next generation of lawyers on the market, and I want to thank you for that.\nShawn CThird Year Student, University College London\nAfter receiving countless rejections, finding and signing up to The Corporate Law Academy has definitely increased my confidence when applying for a Training Contract. Upon receiving feedback on my application, I was surprised at the amount of effort that Jaysen had put in to his response. Taking the comments on board, I produced a second draft and Jaysen was more than willing to take a look. Jaysen\u2019s recommendations are always detailed, clear and very constructive. The same can be said for his weekly commercial awareness articles. I would definitely recommend The Corporate Law Academy to anyone wishing to improve their applications or interview techniques!\nSophiaSophia, London School of Economics\nSSI cannot put into words how helpful the virtual training programme is. First of all, knowing that I have a session coming up makes me motivated to keep up to date with the news which is already beneficial. Secondly, while I may think that I know something very well, when it comes to explaining it, I realise that I should read it into it more. So, this exercise has really helped me understand my strengths and weaknesses, and work towards improving the same. At the same time, since the first training session, I have been paying more attention to different concepts and terminologies in articles, and I am in a better position to have a conversation with someone on difficult topics. The structure of each session is great \u2013 \u2018throwing\u2019 questions on each person can be quite challenging and it is also really useful listening to the perspective of other people in the session. The group exercise has also helped me improve the way I collaborate with my teammates. Apart from the great quality of the programme, I think what really differentiates this programme from other training tools, is the way you and Alice make the questions or raise additional points in the discussion. It may be challenging but it\u2019s so friendly at the some time, and I feel encouraged to share my views, even though they may not be 100% correct. I am not afraid to make mistakes and that\u2019s something you don\u2019t find everywhere.\nHonestly, the scholarship been such a massive help to me in making applications- I actually got two magic circle interview offers from the back of the help I received from the TCLA scholarship!\nThe TCLA 2019 scholarship programme was invaluable when it came to helping me apply for vacation schemes and training contracts. Through utilising the courses offered by the programme, such as the \u201cLegal Technology Crash Course\u201d and the \u201cM&A Crash Course\u201d, I now feel much more comfortable with legal topics I had previously been unsure about. TCLA\u2019s law firm insights have helped me make tailored applications to firms, and have helped me increase the number of interviews I am being invited to. Their video interview simulator was also incredibly insightful. By using the simulator prior to an interview, I calmed my nerves down regarding the process while also receiving helpful feedback that helped me improve my video interviewing technique. Overall, the TCLA Scholarship has been a wonderful aid in helping me navigate the difficult process of applying for training contracts.\nSyeda Rubab ZahraTrainee Solicitor, International Law Firm, Class of 2020, TCLA Scholarship\nI attended the training session. Jaysen was incredibly insightful down to the last detail and even provided guidance to us on how to approach applications and interviews. Jaysen was very genuine and personal in helping me with my application review and provided me with detailed recommendations line-by-line. He responds quickly and is very approachable and reliable as he understands what it was like to be a student. I would recommend him to any student who wishes to improve the quality of their applications.\nSylvester TanSylvester Tan, Vac schemes at Clifford Chance, Weil and Winston & Strawn\nMahesh was very kind and considerate but also very realistic and pragmatic. I liked the way he delivered feedback, but also really listened to what I was saying and was interested in making my answers as strong as possible.\nTA\nI just have to thank you for TCLA. It is undoubtedly the best service on offer for this process, and I would wholeheartedly recommend premium to anyone making the same journey as myself. Over the summer, I spent hours upon hours studying TCLA\u2019s premium content. The law firm profiles were invaluable in terms of finding truly differentiating features between firms. I would also highlight the \u2018Mastering the City\u2019, \u2018TCLA to TC\u2019 and \u2018The Interviewees\u2019 Guide to Mergers and Acquisitions\u2019 courses insofar as they provide expert advice in a very manageable form. Finally, the application review service gave me the confidence that I can write cogently and convincingly.\nSo really, all I need to say is, PLEASE keep doing what you\u2019re doing! I know it will change the lives of so many more people.\nTM\nLast week, after three years of applying for vacation schemes and training contracts without so much as a video interview invite, I secured a training contract with [redacted] after my first ever assessment centre!\nI\u2019m slightly in awe: as a non-law, international student from a non-Russell group university, I assumed that there was absolutely no way that a major law firm would ever consider my application.\nI\u2019ve used TCLA for every step of the application process, and it\u2019s absolutely made the difference. The crash-course on the Watson Glaser has since helped me get through nine different critical thinking tests, and the application database was so helpful in understanding the subtle differences between each firm.\nThe most significant help was a chance for a free mock interview in June: Mahesh was a fantastic interviewer and his feedback made me incredibly confident going into my interviews.\nThe week before my assessment centre, I ran through the TCLA Gold\u2019s M&A Bootcamp and the other case studies available on the site which really helped me understand how to approach the case study and written exercise portions of the day.\n\u2026I\u2019m really grateful to have had such an incredible and reliable resource to turn to when I was feeling discouraged or ready to give up.\nVO\nBoth my parents are refugees from Afghanistan who settled in North London, where I was born and raised. I\u2019m a proud Londoner and Arsenal fan who studies LLB Law with Politics at the University of Essex.\nSince being awarded the TCLA Scholarship I have found the team at TCLA to be incredibly supportive in terms of applications, advice but more importantly personal development. The resources offered on the programme have benefited me in so many ways. Having access to the commercial awareness courses, introduction to the city course and premium forum has really benefited me in terms of becoming a more well-rounded law student and future vac scheme applicant. The team\u2019s review of my application also made it easier for me to understand my (many!) mistakes and offered advice that was both supportive and critical. I have to say that without the scholarship and having the assistance from TCLA I would not have progressed as much as I have in my development as an aspiring commercial solicitor. If you meet the criteria, I would highly encourage you to apply!\nYusuf PanahClass of 2020, TCLA Scholarship\nI have been offered a TC by [redacted]! I am absolutely overjoyed and cannot thank both you and TCLA enough for all the support through this process. Without the TCLA scholarship, I genuinely would not have been able to secure this training contract, as not only did it allow me to really get to grips with commercial topics, it also helped alleviate a lot of the stress that came with being someone who had no prior contact with law at all.\nThank you once more for everything, I really do appreciate everything that you do on your amazing platform.\nZF\nI attended the training session. Jaysen was incredibly insightful down to the last detail and even provided guidance to us on how to approach applications and interviews. Jaysen was very genuine and personal in helping me with my application review and provided me with detailed recommendations line-by-line. He responds quickly and is very approachable and reliable as he understands what it was like to be a student. I would recommend him to any student who wishes to improve the quality of their applications.\nSylvester Tan\nAEThe virtual training programs have been extremely useful. They have provided me with invaluable information about the types of questions law firms may ask and the best ways to approach answering these. Additionally, the programs have allowed me to practice taking part in virtual assessments. This has boosted my confidence for participating in an up coming virtual assessment centre. I cannot thank Jaysen and Alice enough for their time and efforts.\nHi Jaysen,\nI hope you are well.\nI thought I would drop you a line to explain why I have decided to cancel my TCLA premium subscription, just in case you thought it was due to dissatisfaction with the service I have received. That is certainly not the case. Rather, I have recently received a training contract offer from Travers Smith and will be accepting the offer.\nWhen I started using TCLA premium earlier this year, I lacked a lot of confidence in my ability to write a convincing application, my ability to assimilate complex commercial topics and my all-round ability to navigate through the TC process in order to actually obtain an offer. However, I began to use TCLA premium for hours upon end each day throughout lockdown 1.0, from the law firm insights you provide in order to better tailor my apps to the various courses you offer aimed at demystifying the elusive notion of \u2018commercial awareness\u2019 just to build up an arsenal of commercial aptitude that would leave me in good stead for AC\u2019s and interviews, and my confidence began to dramatically swing in the other direction. I began to get past the application stage in the vast majority of my apps and I began to believe in my ability to perform exceptionally at the AC/interview stage. TCLA has undoubtedly been instrumental in allowing me to unlock my true potential and iron out deficiencies in my all-round approach to the TC process that had been holding me back for years.\nI could not be happier with the service I have received and it is the best money I have ever spent. Thank you for your relentless efforts to continuously provide such a first-class service that really does have the capability to change lives.\nAll the best\nNF"}}
