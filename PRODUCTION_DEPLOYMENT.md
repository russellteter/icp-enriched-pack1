# Production Deployment Guide - ICP Discovery Engine

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to Railway (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login to Railway
railway login

# 3. Deploy from this directory
railway up

# 4. Set environment variables (if not using railway.json config)
railway variables set BUDGET_MAX_SEARCHES=200
railway variables set BUDGET_MAX_FETCHES=300
railway variables set BUDGET_MAX_ENRICH=150

# 5. Get your production URL
railway domain
```

Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### Step 2: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health

# Test workflow execution
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"segment": "healthcare", "targetcount": 5, "mode": "fast", "region": "na"}' \
  https://your-app-name.railway.app/run
```

### Step 3: Access Web Interface
1. Visit: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
2. Navigate to the Streamlit dashboard
3. Start discovering ICP organizations!

## 🔧 Production Configuration

### Environment Variables (Auto-configured in railway.json)
```bash
# Resource Limits
BUDGET_MAX_SEARCHES=200      # Max search queries per workflow
BUDGET_MAX_FETCHES=300       # Max web page fetches per workflow
BUDGET_MAX_ENRICH=150        # Max Explorium enrichments per workflow
CACHE_TTL_SECS=604800        # Cache expiry (7 days)
PER_DOMAIN_FETCH_CAP=50      # Per-domain fetch limit

# Performance Settings
MODE=fast                    # Default execution mode
ALLOWLIST_DOMAINS=...        # Pre-configured domain allow-list

# Auto-scaling (Railway handles this)
uvicorn --workers 2          # Multiple worker processes for higher throughput
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Deployment Fails**
   - Check Railway build logs: `railway logs`
   - Verify requirements.txt is complete
   - Ensure all environment variables are set

2. **Health Check Fails**  
   - Check server logs for startup errors
   - Verify all required directories exist (`runs/latest/`, etc.)
   - Test locally first: `uvicorn src.server.app:app --port 8080`

3. **Workflow Execution Issues**
   - Check budget limits in environment variables
   - Verify internet connectivity for web scraping
   - Monitor rate limits on external APIs

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor Railway metrics for resource usage
   - Check cache hit rates in `/metrics` endpoint
   - Consider scaling up Railway plan for high loads
